            <p>
                Developing our game required many different areas around game design and development to be explored. 
                Throughout this project, I was personally responsible for implementing many major features. Such things as scripted behaviour for entities, survival mechanisms and assets and UI design and implementation. 
                One the of most notable features I fully developed was the final boss battle between the playerâ€™s ship and an enemy ship as a climactic finish for the game.

            <p>
                Very minor details of this game can be discussed as this game was developed was an external party outside of the university.
